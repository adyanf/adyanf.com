```
Hello World!
```

A typical first message a software engineer usually writes when learning a new programming language.

So, hello world! ðŸ¤£

This is my first post in a long time. I've always wanted to have an online presence in form of a blog.
Despite numerous attempts to create one, my previous blogs remained empty â€“ a common struggle, I believe! ðŸ˜„
Hopefully, this time, I can consistently write something even if it's not always important.

My goal in writing this blog is to share my knowledge on software engineering, but it will probably be more than that.
I want to share a little piece of my life, experiences, thoughts, and feelings.

I hope that someday what I write on this blog could be useful for someone out there.

Okay, that's it for now. Until next time. Bye.

Sincerely,\
Adya
