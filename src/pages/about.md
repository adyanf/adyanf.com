I am a software engineer passionate about System Architecture, Distributed Systems, and Mobile Application. I also have an interest on Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I work mainly as Backend Engineer at [AlloFresh](https://allofresh.id), building e-grocery experience in Indonesia.

Before my current role, I worked at [Bukalapak](https://www.bukalapak.com) as Mobile App Engineer (Android) on O2O Team, building Mitra Bukalapak application.

For my study, I went to [Bandung Institute of Technology](), majoring in Informatics Engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy playing sports like football, badminton, and racing (go-kart).
Additionally, I have a passion for traveling, and my ultimate goal is to explore every continent in the world.
